# Machine Learning

This repository is just a collection of my path on becoming a professional machine learning specialist.

Modules I will be using are
* numpy
* pandas
* sklearn
* matplotlib
* seaborn

For amazon_review.py I only used the test.csv of [Amazon Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritanjalijain/amazon-reviews?select=test.csv) due to the size of the csv file. I used naive bayes for this dataset.
For number_recognition.py I used the [MNIST numbers](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer) dataset. I will probably try to use deep learning later on to increase my accuracy since K-Means clustering can confuse digits like 3 and 8 very easily.
